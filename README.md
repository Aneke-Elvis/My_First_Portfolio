# HTML Basics Project

This project is part of my learning journey in web development.  
It focuses on the **fundamentals of HTML** — how it works, how to use tags and attributes, and how to build simple, valid web pages.

## 📌 General Requirements
- Recommended editor: **Visual Studio Code**
- All project files should end with a newline
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory (this file ✅)
- **No external libraries** allowed:
  - ❌ NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
  - ✅ Only pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Code must be **W3C compliant** and validated using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## 🎯 Program Outcomes
By completing this project, I will be able to:
- Explain what **HTML** is and how it works.
- Create my own HTML pages using **valid markup**.
- Use **tags and attributes** correctly to structure content.
- Understand what a **markup language** is and how it helps browsers render web pages.

## 🚀 What I Can Do After This Project
- Build basic web pages (personal bios, lists, simple documents).
- Write **clean, readable HTML code** with confidence.
- Lay the groundwork for learning **CSS** and **JavaScript** later.
